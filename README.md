Loot Filters is an extended version of the builtin Ground Items plugin. It replicates the majority of the features in
the builtin, and adds support for scriptable "loot filters".

## Get started
By default the plugin downloads and selects the "FilterScape" filter, which is meant to be useful by default
and supports intelligent filtering for a variety of PvM scenarios. You can visit https://filterscape.xyz/ to customize it.

## Loot filters

Loot filters allow in-depth customization of when and how items are displayed.

Loot filters allow you to do things like the following:
* filter based on many characteristics of a ground item beyond its name / ID
  * value
  * quantity
  * tradeable
  * stackable
  * noted
  * "ownership" value
* conditionally hide items based on map area (e.g. hide UN-noted blue dhide specifically at vorkath)
* extended display configuration - background / border, custom menu / lootbeam text colors, and more
* play a sound on item drop
* sort menu entries for ground items

The above teaser image provides an example of what is possible with this plugin.
